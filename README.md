# Full Stack Open 2021 - Notes App Web
App proposed by the program [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en) by the **University of Helsinki**.

## Part 2 Communicating with server
we will take a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. After this, we will inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Next, our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. Lastly, we will take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.<br>
**a** - Rendering a collection, modules <br>
**b** - Forms <br>
**c** - Getting data from server <br>
**d** - Altering data in server <br>
**e** - Adding styles to React App <br>

## Part 5 Testing React app
In this part we return to the frontend, first looking at different possibilities for testing the React code. We will also implement token based authentication which will enable users to log in to our application.<br>
